## Welcome to My Page

Hello! 

My name is Ruyuan. I graduated from Case Western Reserve Univeristy (CWRU) in Jan 2021, with B.A. in Computer Science. 


### Education

- Major: Computer Science, cum laude  

- Dean's Honor List (Fall 2017, Fall 2018) and Dean's High Honors (Spring 2019, Spring 2020)

- SOURCE summer funding awardee on project “Predictive Model for Extraprostatic Extension of Radiomics Derived from Periprostatic Fat on Prostate MRI”

- Relevant Course: 


  ● Intro to Artificial Intelligence ● Database Systems ● Statistics using R ● Operating System and Concurrent Programming
  ● Structured and Unstructured Data ● Bioinformatics ● Probabilistic Graphic Model ● Computational Intelligence ● Computer architecture



### Research and Design Experience

##### CENTER FOR COMPUTATIONAL IMAGING & PERSONALIZED DIAGNOSTICS
-	Derive radiomic features from prostate MRI with first- and second- order statistics (CoLIAGe, Gabor, Haralick and Gradient Sobel)
-	Optimal feature selection with mRMR, JMI and CMIM models for training set
-	Using machine learning models like Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression to identify a best classifier
-	Achieved 0.88 AUC with identifying prognostic bio-markers

##### CWRU DEPT. OF COMPUTER AND DATA SCIENCE
- Used Cox Regression to calculate survival probabilities in R
-	Adapted Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) to identify the length of survival with time series data

### Practical Experience

##### Deep Learning in Sex Trafficking | March 2020 – December 2020           
###### Personal and Course Project: Machine Learning, Deep Learning
- Implemented Fully Connected Neural Networks (FNN) to study mediating factors in sex trafficking 
- Used NLP package (nltk.parse, nltk.CFG) to generate trafficking related semantics

##### YouTube Data Analysis | August 2020 – December 2020                  
###### Course Project: Structured and Unstructured Data
- Created data storage system with PageRank algorithm to understand YouTube data 
- Concluded that 80% of the top three recommendations using the algorithm clustered on the same category of video leading to potential information biases
