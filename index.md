## Welcome to Ruyuan's Homepage

Hello! 

My name is Ruyuan. I graduated from Case Western Reserve Univeristy (CWRU) in Jan 2021, with B.A. in Computer Science. I am currently a MSCS student at University of Southern California.


### Education
#### University of Southern California
- Major: Computer Science, track Artificial Intelligence

#### Case Western Reserve Univeristy (CWRU)
- Major: Computer Science, cum laude  

- Dean's Honor List (Fall 2017, Fall 2018) and Dean's High Honors (Spring 2019, Spring 2020)

- SOURCE summer funding awardee on project “Predictive Model for Extraprostatic Extension of Radiomics Derived from Periprostatic Fat on Prostate MRI”

- Relevant Courses: 


  ● Intro to Artificial Intelligence ● Database Systems ● Statistics using R ● Operating System and Concurrent Programming
  ● Structured and Unstructured Data ● Bioinformatics ● Probabilistic Graphic Model ● Computational Intelligence ● Computer architecture



### Research and Design Experience

#### Reserch Assistant | March 2019 – March 2021
##### Center for Computational Imaging and Personalized Diagnostics
-	Derive radiomic features from prostate MRI with first- and second- order statistics (CoLIAGe, Gabor, Haralick and Gradient Sobel)
-	Optimal feature selection with mRMR, JMI and CMIM models for training set
-	Using machine learning models like Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression to identify a best classifier
-	Achieved 0.88 AUC with identifying prognostic bio-markers



#### Reserch Assistant | August 2020 – November 2020
##### CWRU Department of Computer and Data Science
- Used Cox Regression to calculate survival probabilities in R
-	Adapted Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) to identify the length of survival with time series data

### Practical Experience

#### Deep Learning in Sex Trafficking | March 2020 – December 2020           
##### Personal and Course Project: Machine Learning, Deep Learning
- Implemented Fully Connected Neural Networks (FNN) to study mediating factors in sex trafficking 
- Used NLP package (nltk.parse, nltk.CFG) to generate trafficking related semantics

#### YouTube Data Analysis | August 2020 – December 2020                  
##### Course Project: Structured and Unstructured Data
- Created data storage system with PageRank algorithm to understand YouTube data 
- Concluded that 80% of the top three recommendations using the algorithm clustered on the same category of video leading to potential information biases


### Work Experience and Extracurricular
#### Mentor | September 2020 – January 2021
##### CWRU Undergraduate Research Society
-	Connect with freshmen interested in research. Offer advice and guidance for identifying and conducting research
